## The Plan

Keep routing in App.js and use react-router to update urls. Keep overall data in a context which is updated on page submission. Transitions will be done using react-transition-group. Styling will be done with styled-components leveraging off the Materialize CSS library.

### Instructions

1. Clone from https://github.com/dunton/smalls-challenge.git
2. Navigate into `smalls-challenge`
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`, this could take awhile depending on what you already have installed on your machine
4. Run server using `npm start`
