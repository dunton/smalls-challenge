## The Plan

Keep routing in App.js and use react-router to update urls. We will use the Hash Router to avoid any backend issues that sometimes arise with BrowserRouter. Keep overall data in a context which is updated on page submission. Styling will be done with styled-components leveraging off the Materialize CSS library.

### Instructions
